# 🧠 Architecture Explanation

This project uses **Service Layer Architecture**:

### 🔹 Routes Layer

Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST, DELETE)

### 🔹 Services Layer

Contains all business logic (validation, queries, rules)

### 🔹 Models Layer

Defines database tables using SQLAlchemy

### 🔹 Schemas Layer

Handles request/response validation using Pydantic

# 🔄 Application Flow

## Example: Create Enrollment

```text id="flow1"
Client (Postman)
    ↓
Route Layer (enrollment.py)
    ↓
Service Layer (business logic)
    ↓
Validation (student + course check)
    ↓
Duplicate check
    ↓
Model (SQLAlchemy)
    ↓
Database
    ↓
Response to client
```

# 🧪 Testing (Postman Example)

## Create Enrollment

```json id="post1"
POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/enrollments
```

```json id="post2"
{
  "student_id": 1,
  "course_id": 1
}
```
